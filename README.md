🎬 AI Movie Recommendation System
This project is a content-based movie recommendation system built using Python, pandas, and scikit-learn. It analyzes movie metadata to suggest similar movies based on genres, keywords, cast, and director information.

📂 Dataset
The system utilizes a CSV file named movies.csv, which should contain the following columns:

title
genres
keywords
cast
director
Ensure that the dataset is placed in the same directory as the script or provide the correct path to the file.

⚙️ Features
Content-Based Filtering: Recommends movies by analyzing textual metadata.
TF-IDF Vectorization: Converts textual data into numerical features using Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency.
Cosine Similarity: Measures the similarity between movies based on their feature vectors.
Fuzzy Title Matching: Handles user input errors by finding the closest matching movie title.
🛠️ Installation
Clone the Repository:

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ai-movie-recommender.git
cd ai-movie-recommender
Install Dependencies:

Ensure you have Python 3.x installed. Then, install the required Python packages:

pip install pandas scikit-learn
🚀 Usage
Prepare the Dataset:

Ensure that movies.csv is present in the project directory and contains the necessary columns.

Run the Script:

Execute the Python script:

python movie_recommender.py
Interact with the System:

When prompted, enter a movie title to receive top 10 similar movie recommendations.

🧠 How It Works
Data Loading:

Loads a subset of the dataset (default 1000 rows) to manage memory usage.

Data Preprocessing:

Cleans and standardizes textual data by converting to lowercase and removing spaces.
Combines genres, keywords, cast, and director into a single string for each movie.
Feature Extraction:

Applies TF-IDF vectorization to the combined features to convert text into numerical vectors.

Similarity Computation:

Calculates cosine similarity between all movie vectors to determine their closeness.

Recommendation Generation:

Matches user input to the closest movie title using fuzzy matching.
Retrieves and displays the top 10 movies with the highest similarity scores.
📝 Example
AI Movie Recommender System
Enter a movie title: Inception

Top 10 Recommendations:

1. Interstellar
2. The Prestige
3. Memento
4. The Matrix
5. Shutter Island
6. The Dark Knight
7. The Illusionist
8. Source Code
9. Looper
10. Edge of Tomorrow
📌 Notes
The default chunk_size is set to 1000 to manage memory usage. Adjust this value based on your system's capabilities.
Ensure that all required columns are present in the dataset. Missing columns are filled with empty strings during preprocessing.
The fuzzy matching cutoff is set to 0.6. Adjust this threshold in the get_closest_match function if needed.
